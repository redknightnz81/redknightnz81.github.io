<p>To view the original page, click <a href = "http://www.stetsongroup.com" target = "_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>This redesign started out by the site owner asking what could be done about their website to make it more 'mobile friendly'.</p>
<p>I have used the colours from the main site, and kept the large banner image for upcoming shows.</p>
<p>Also contains a long list of upcoming and past shows as per the full site.</p>
<p>Only this home page was made in the mockup, as shortly after they informed me that they had found someone else to undertake a 'mobile friendly' update to their website.</p>
