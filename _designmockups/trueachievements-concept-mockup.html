<p>This redesign started out just as a way to add some design mockups onto my own website, and see what I could come up with.</p>
<p>Updated it to a more modern look and feel - in my opinion.</p>
<p>Moved the main navigation and menus from top of page, to a sticky left aligned menu.</p>
<p>Added in a few more design tweaks which I quite like.</p>
