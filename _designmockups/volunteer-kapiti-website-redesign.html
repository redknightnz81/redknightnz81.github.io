<p>I created this concept after one of the managers of Volunteer Kapiti visited a course I was on at the time, seeing if people would be interested in volunteering, the class tutor mentioned my background in website development and went from there.</p>
<p>I started by updating the logo a bit, moving it to the left and adding in their motto to the right.</p>
<p>Updated the colour scheme to match the greens and red of their logo.</p>
<p>Project would have involved being moved onto WordPress - their request.</p>
<p>Unfortunately this did not proceed due to time constraints and underestimating the work involved.</p>
<p>I provided them with what I had done, and the design files if they wished to hand it on to someone else.</p>
