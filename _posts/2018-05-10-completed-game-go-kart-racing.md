<p>The achievements in this game are very easy to get.  Took less than an hour to get all.  Luckily the race position achievements stack.</p>
<p>I did need to set the race length to 10 laps for the oval track to make it easier to get the 1st place achievement.</p>
<p>For the 88mph achievement, use the third track and try and take the corners as smoothly as possible to carry speed onto the long straight.  Just keep driving straight into the end wall if needed and the achievement will pop as soon as you hit 88mph.</p>
<p>Luckily I got the game as part of a bundle with a few other games for US$3.49 on IndieGala, otherwise I would not have purchased it - considering the steam store price is US$19.99 / NZ$24.79 and that there is only 3 tracks the game is massively overpriced.</p>
