Have purchased the following recently:
– Jimmie Johnson’s Anything With an Engine (NTSC) – has arrived
– Nascar 2011 (NTSC) – has arrived
– Crash Time 1 and 2 (PAL)
– Ski-Doo Racing (NTSC)
– SBK 08 (NTSC) after first purchase lost in post from USA
– Ben 10 Galactic Racing

Unfortunately after almost 10 weeks of waiting for SBK 08 (NTSC) to arrive from USA, I gave up on it ever arriving.
The seller on eBay was all good about it, and quickly issued a refund into my PayPal account.
Have decided to get another copy from somewhere else though (as they aren’t the cheapest price wise currently).

With weekend coming up, it is time for thinking about some kind of schedule to get the most gamerscore or complete some games.
I am finding it hardest to get the online Italian DLC done for Need For Speed: The Run, as well as the level 30 – currently half way through level 25.
I will likely wait until their next race weekend, which doubles XP given.
Possibly move onto some F1 2010, Indianapolis 500 Evolution or Stuntman: Ignition.
F1 2010 or Stuntman is more likely as they are PAL games, and I really can’t stand the noise my NTSC console makes. It is one of the first revisions with an HDMI port, so it is a lot noisier than my Jasper PAL console.
May have to think about upgrading it to a Jasper or a new S model.
