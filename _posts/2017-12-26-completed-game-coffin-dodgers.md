This is the second completion so far today - yippee!

Overall I found this game quite fun to play, not overly difficult to complete and would recommend it if you are into arcade / kart racing type games.  There are however pickups / weapons in the game which can make winning / losing races a bit frustrating at times (I can't remember if they can be disabled or not).

The online achievements are the real hassle with getting the achievements completed in this games.  There are achievements for specific dates (Christmas, Valentines, Halloween) and every day of the week.

Luckily, most the online achievements can be done by yourself, just waiting for the lobby to fill with AI controlled competitors.  There are two achievements that will require assistance from someone else who has the game.  Luckily they are straight forward enough and only take 10 - 15 minutes for both people to get them.
