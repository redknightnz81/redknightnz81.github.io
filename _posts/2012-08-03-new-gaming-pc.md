Finally have dumped the old P4 3GHz system.

New system has a GPU with more memory than old PC hahaha (I know they aren't comparable blah blah blah).

System Specs:
ASUS P8Z77-V LK
i5 3570K Ivy Bridge 3.40Ghz
Prolimatech Black Megahalems CPU Cooler
Patriot Viper Xtreme 16GB (2x8GB) DDR3-1866 CL9
Intel 330 Series 120GB 2.5" SATA3 6GB/s SSD
ASUS DRW-24B3ST 24X DVD Writer SATA
Seasonic M12II 650W 80Plus Bronze Power Supply
CoolerMaster Silencio 550 Mid Tower
Windows 7 Home Premium 64Bit
EVGA 670 2GB FTW

Had to have the graphics card replaced already (after a day) and got a replacement already - have had the computer for a week without the GPU.
The errors that originally appeared regarding the graphics driver crashing appeared after playing F1 2011 (PC) last night. Had been playing for a few hours so may have been overheating (?).
I shutdown the PC for about 30 mins with the case front door opened and started it up again and no errors - but will keep an eye on it over weekend just in case. If it needs replacing again, then I will be getting a different brand (and maybe pay for an upgrade to a 680 or just ditch nvidia and go ATI.

Have also started a few more games, but can't be bothered adding a new post for all of them :P
