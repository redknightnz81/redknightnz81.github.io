Considering the fun that I had playing DiRT 2, 3 and DiRT Rally, I consider this game a disappointment.  I can only hope that they add in more game types and content via free (haha unlikely) DLC.

I would have loved there to be more Rallycross events, but all there is only the tracks from DiRT Rally - what a waste of the FIA World Rallycross license.  Would love to have more of the tracks, if not all of them.

The number of countries and rallies are also quite disappointing.  They all seem to overlap one another quite often and can notice it quite quickly.  While going for the completion of achievements the tracks just became too repetitive.

The trophy truck events are quite good, but again under utilised.  As are the joyride events - which I think could have been integrated more into the career as bonus events.

Would also like to mention that the game was constantly CTD (crashing to desktop) on me.  It usually happened while in the 4th rally / event and became quite frustrating having to do rallies over again.

Overall, I probably wouldn't recommend getting the game - especially at full price unless you are a die hard rally game fan.  Even that isn't a strong enough reason considering the other better options out there.
