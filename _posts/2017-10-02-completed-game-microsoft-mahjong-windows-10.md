I enjoy playing this game every once in a while and finally decided to put in the effort to complete the monthly challenges to get the completion.

I did have to use the trick of setting the PC date settings back to months where the challenges were yet to be completed.

I also purchased a month of premium (ha!) membership to give double the coins - and get rid of the annoying in-game F2P adverts.
