There was a grind involved in getting the achievment for unlocking all bikes - which required 10 seasons in career mode to get the amount of cash needed.

Also had to organise someone to help me with the online achievements.  Tried with someone in NZ like myself, but never able to connect.  Must be due to all the servers being in Europe and connection there and back not coping - only my most likely incorrect assumption there.
