Game seems to have changed it's name between CrazyCar and ColourCar.  

First of a few easy completions that I plan to get over the next few days.

Very easy game to get through, just involves staying on the track for a certain amount of time while the score increases.

Sadly buying different cars didn't seem to change any of the handling or speed characteristics of the game, all the cars seemed to drive in exactly the same manner.
