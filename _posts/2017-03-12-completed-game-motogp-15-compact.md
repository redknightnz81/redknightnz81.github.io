Yet again, the only real difficulty was arranging a time to do the online achievements with someone.

The other achievements were very straight forward and just required wins with specific teams and other easy tasks that just about any level player could manage.

The online stats got reset on me, so had to start the online races over again which added another 1 hr to the completion time of 5 1/2 hrs.

Will now see if I can complete the Colin McRae rally game (the recent mobile port "remastered" one).
