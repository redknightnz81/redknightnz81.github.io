Career mode is very easy to get through, and doesn't provide much of a challenge.  Even more so when it bugs out and sends you to the last race of the championship after completing the previous one.

Online multiplayer is a serious grind to get through.  Luckily there is also a bug in that which counts the number of people in the race as the number of races completed.  So if 3 people in the race, it counts as 3 races completed after each race.  Still makes going for the 1000 races completed a serious pain though.

Overall, if the online mode wasn't a part of the game (like the console release - Race Arcade), and it was a bit cheaper, then I would have no problem recommending it, as it is a very enjoyable top-down view racing game.
