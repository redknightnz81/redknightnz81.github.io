A straight forward game that has no online achievements required for the completion (there is online modes included, but I didn't play as no achievements lol).

Not a lot of skill required to get the completion.  Difficulty of the AI competitors can be lowered to Easy/Very Easy if needed and don't affect achievements.

Most of the achievements can be had in Career mode, and once those are completed can get the remainder of the necessary 50 grand prixs in standard single player grand prix mode as it requires only 1 race in a race weekend, instead of the 2 in career mode.
