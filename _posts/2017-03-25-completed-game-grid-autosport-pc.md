A really brilliant racing game, only let down by the repetitiveness of the online level achievement.

I suppose that won't apply to people who don't play for the achievements.....

132 hrs total playtime, and most of that game time was swapping wins in online multiplayer on the fastest track using the fastest cars available.

Achievement required level 50 for each of the racing categories in the game (Touring, Endurance, Open Wheel, Tuner and Street).

Just hoping that the next GRID game doesn't include an achievement like this (or DiRT 4 for that matter).
