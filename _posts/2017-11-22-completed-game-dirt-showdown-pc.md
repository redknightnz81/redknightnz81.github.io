Yet another game that have previously completed on Xbox360.

Overall I quite enjoyed the game, and wasn't difficult to complete.  Just a very long grind.

To get the online XP level achievements quickly it requires a lot of organisation to get a large group together and a shortcut on a specific set of tracks.  Even then it takes a VERY LONG time to get.
