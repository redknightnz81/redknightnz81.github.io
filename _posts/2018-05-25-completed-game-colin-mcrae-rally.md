<p>Simply put, I think Codemasters should be ashamed of themselves for thinking that this is a good game and worthy of release.</p>
<p>Shameless PC port of a mobile version of the Colin McRae Rally game series.  Terrible controls, terrible graphics, short campaign, limited cars.  Just overall terrible and I am glad to be done with it.</p>
<p>Is regularly on sale if you are desperate for it, but I would highly recommend avoiding this game at all costs as there are much better games available for the same or near to the price that this is being sold for.</p>
