Second time going through this game - as this is yet another racing game that I have already completed on X360.

Luckily arranged with some one to do the co-op online career achievements as that was the only real block to completing all achievements in this game.

Game has since been removed from Steam - my guess is that licensing agreement expired, same reason with Grid as removed at same time.
