Really enjoyed playing this game again - apart from the gymkhana.
Luckily this game was given away for free on humblebundle.com so the multiplayer lobbies were quite full.
Joined a steam group for the Superstar achievement and managed to get it done reasonably quickly.
Third time completing the same game - X360, GfWL and now Steam.
Has just been removed off the Steam store at end of 2016 - my guess is licensing agreement has expired.
