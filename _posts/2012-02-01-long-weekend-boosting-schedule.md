So I have been thinking about what I am planning to play / boost this long weekend - in New Zealand it is Waitangi Day on Monday.

In no particular order:

F1 2010.

Having just completed F1 2011 (was much easier) I thought about going back to this to see if I can get the Expert difficulty achievement done.

Crash Time 1 (US).

Haven't started this one yet.  If anything like the third game it should be relatively easy.

Indianapolis 500 (US).

Started the main career which ramped up the difficulty, some events to get gold in, then that leaves the online.

Nascar 08 and Nascar 09 (US).

Have completed the EU version of 09, but servers shut down recently for 09 US and a long time ago for 08 (EU & US) so won't be able to get 1000G completion on those :(

Fatal Inertia.

Have recently seen someone on my friends list playing it, and have only just started the main career.

Stuntman Ignition.

Want to try and get the Constructor 4 & 5 star achievements done eventually.

Not a big fan of the story / career mode, so will leave that until I am in the mood for it.

SBK X (US).

Would like to complete this game.  NTSC version apparently does not have the glitched "Complete all Extras" achievement due to the Kyoko helmet being removed / patched in US version.

Have the 2000 miles (or was it km) to ride and been a while since I played it, so not sure how far along I am with that.

Need For Speed: The Run.

Have found a relatively quick way to get XP to get through the grinding of levels.

Currently level 24 of 30 (achievement at 25 also).

Don't think I will be getting the Italian Pack DLC - I say that now, but will probably end up getting it for completions sake.
