<p>Rather long completion only due to the need to collect rider coins to purchase bonuses.</p>
<p>Game save corrupted, but luckily had not been playing this particular game for a while, so a backup was found that only resulted in 1 or 2 hours of actual progress being lost.</p>
<p>Game has online achievements which may be an issue for people to get as online seemed very quiet.  Luckily I had a friend with the game and they were kindly able to help me get the acheivements.</p>
