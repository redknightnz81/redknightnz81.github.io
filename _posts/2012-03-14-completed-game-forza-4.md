That's right!

Finished off "The Bucket List" on Sunday Morning, had a break for a few hours and then "Forza World Tourer" later that evening.
Forza World Tourer didn't take long at all, just had some of the downhill / uphill Fujimi Kaido tracks, Drag tracks and Top Gear tracks to do.

Very happy that it is over and done with.
Total driving time was over 150 hours!
