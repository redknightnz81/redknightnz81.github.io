Bland and repetitive motorbike/ATV game.

The graphics are not very well done, the handling is shocking and overall it just seems like a shoddy port of the console version.

There is also an achievement that requires a win against a full grid of human players which is a nightmare to organise - more so since the online community is non-existant.  I had to get up at 4:30 to get in a group of people over in Europe / Russia / USA to get this achievement.

About the only positive part of this game is that I got it on sale.  Very glad I didn't pay full price for this.
