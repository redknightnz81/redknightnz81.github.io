<p>Very cool little game which is a "Sin City" gritty art style top down racer and is a lot of fun to play.</p>
<p>Achievements weren't very difficult to get, I found the quickest way to level up was in a private lobby by myself with no AI in two race tournaments, each level took 20 to 25 minutes to get.</p>
<p>Looks like the developers have gone a bit quiet since releasing the game as there was a few updates with more tracks after release.  To be fair, the game could use some more vehicle types and tracks I feel.</p>
