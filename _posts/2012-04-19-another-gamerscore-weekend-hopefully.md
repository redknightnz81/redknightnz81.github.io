Planning what to play this weekend, and decided I need to hold off on starting Ridge Racer Unbounded and make a bit more of an effort to complete some older games.

I am starting to fall quite badly behind on the global leaderboard – only just maintaining my 20th position. I am not too bothered with Oceania at the moment, as I know the person in 1st position doesn't have an NTSC console or a WP7 phone (not that I game on it much).

Anyway, here is the list of games I am going to try and get a few more achievements in this weekend, and see if I can't complete at least one or two of them (in no particular order):
Need For Speed: The Run – grind out level 30, have joined boosting session for Italian DLC pack, so hopefully get that knocked out.
Crash Time 1 (PAL)
Crash Time 2 (PAL) – not started yet
Ski-Doo (US)
SBK 08 (US) – grind out championships wins for gambler achievement and 1000G
Indianapolis 500 Evolution (US)
DreamWorks Super Star Kartz
JJ: AWAE (US)
Nascar 2011 (US)

That may (probably will) all go out the window, as I have just purchased Trials Evolution off XBLA and if I spend any where as much time as I did with the original, then it will be a time-sink.

Happy gaming everyone.
