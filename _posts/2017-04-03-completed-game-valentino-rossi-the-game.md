Not a very difficult game to complete, but the distance achievements are a grind to get through once you have completed the other career based achievements.

Online seems to be broken, in that it requires the people who want to play online in a lobby to be using the minimum level graphics settings in order to get connected to one another.
It took a few connection attempts between myself and the person that I was getting the online achievements completed with, but have since tried to help someone else based in Russia and the connection attempts have always failed.

Will try and complete the last achievements for the Compact version of the game as well, but one of the achievements requires online wins and not really in the mood for it at the moment - especially if it is like this version to connect online with anyone.
F1 games also need some attention so may move onto that instead, or maybe even rFactor 2 ......
