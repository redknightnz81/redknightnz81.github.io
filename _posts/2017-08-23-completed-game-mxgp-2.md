Finally managed to get this game completed thanks to help from a friend to get the online achievement done.

Did have trouble with my poor internet connection, but managed to stay connected long enough and reconnect quick enough that managed to get it done relatively quickly.  Thankfully the game didn't reset championship progress when the connection was lost.

Overall a quite good motorcross game, nothing spectacular - like all Milestone produced games (ha!).  Would recommend getting it on sale, unless you are a die hard MX fan.  Then you might want to get MXGP3 instead (althought I haven't played or own it so can't really recommend it).
