Overall quite a good racing game.  Nothing too difficult to complete in this game in the single player career mode.

Online achievements I was lucky to be a part of a group to get the 8 people required for the achievement.  Someone on my friends list who had already unlocked the other online achievements, was kind enough to help me get the rest of them as well.

There is also a split screen achievement as well, luckily all it required was the two players to crash head-on into one another rather than an actual race (or worse still against AI and get 1st and 2nd places as in MotoGP 13).

About the only real complaint - and it is a minor one - I have is due to the poor english translations of the in game menus and the achievements names and descriptions.

Would recommend buying if you can get it cheap during a sale or as part of a bundle.
