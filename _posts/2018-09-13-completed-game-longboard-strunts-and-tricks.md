<p>Easy game that has a small grind for certain achievements that require crashing or knocking off opponents.</p>
<p>One thing I found out while playing game is that if don't get level specific achievements during play and go through to higher levels, then need to delete save game and go through career again as there is no way to go back through levels once completed.</p>
