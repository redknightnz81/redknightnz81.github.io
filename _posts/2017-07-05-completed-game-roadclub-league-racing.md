Short, Early Access game that only has three achievements.

Made by a small development team of only two people, which is to be commended for what they have produced so far.

I only really played it for the achievements, so in that regard the game was quite good - a top-down view racing game.

I didn't think the UI is that great and could do with an overhaul throughout.  Could do with some more tracks as well.

Will look into it again once the development has progressed a bit further - and see if any more achievements have been added in.
