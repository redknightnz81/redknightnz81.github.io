<p>Purchased and refunded when the game originally released.  Saw it in a bundle at a low price and decided to get it again.</p>
<p>The main difficulty I had with this game was actually the handling.  Once you practise the tracks - some are a lot easier than others - and treat it like a drift car steering, then the races are a lot more manageable and easier to score decent placings in.</p>
<p>Overall though, this game is very average and with only one car - the upgrades not adding a whole lot to it either - and not enough tracks, it is probably a miss or wait for it to be on sale or a bundle if you are interested in it.  I wouldn't recommend paying full price for it.</p>
