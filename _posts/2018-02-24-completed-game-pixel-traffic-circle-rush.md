Very easy game to get play using the keyboard as it just uses the up arrow to speed up to a higher speed and down arrow to slow down.

For achievement hunters, it is best to buy all the cars after getting the coins saved achievements as it is not cumulative.  You need approx 4000 coins to buy all cars to get all achievements, so you will need to keep playing on after getting the highest 3000 coins achievement.

Completion time is approximately 2.5 hours, and it is very repetitive.
