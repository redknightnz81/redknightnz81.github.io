Very easy game to get through, just involves tapping a single key to change the direction of the chosen vehicle to stay on the road.

Made by the same company as Pixel Traffic games that I hope to complete shortly as well, who focus on making child-friendly games.

All the achievements can be gotten in an hour or so, there isn't any grindy achievements like in Circle Rush - another game by same company.
