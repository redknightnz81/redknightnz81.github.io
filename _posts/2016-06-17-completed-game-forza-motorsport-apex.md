Completed this game well before the final achievement popped.
Beta bug on the popping of the achievement meant that I had to do another 6 events to the Platinum medal level.
Brilliant game otherwise â€“ especially since it is free (and I no longer own an Xbox One)
Great tech demo of what Forza Horizon 3 will look like when it releases on PC later in the year.
