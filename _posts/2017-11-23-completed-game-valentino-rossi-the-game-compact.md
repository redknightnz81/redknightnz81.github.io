The only achievement that took any effort was the online achievements.  The other achievements are no hassle at all if you are even a little skilled at racing / motor racing games.

Unfortunately the online achievements are very difficult to get due to the game constantly crashing.  It can be for a variety of reasons - different graphics settings between players, different operating systems, different versions of game (32 or 64 bit), time of day, weather conditions etc. etc.

Luckliy it looks like what ever online structure they had for this game, they have dumped for their newer releases - as well as switching to Unreal engine.
