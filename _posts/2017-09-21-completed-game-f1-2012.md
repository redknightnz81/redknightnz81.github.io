Yet another game that I have already completed on Xbox 360.

Nothing overly difficult about this completion apart from arranging a time with someone to do the online achievements.

Felt quite odd driving against AI named with drivers in their old teams and drivers that are no longer in F1 (M. Schumacher primarily).

Would recommend if you can get it on a sale and if you are an F1 fan, or an achievement hunter - but be aware of the online achievements if you want the completion.
