Very proud of this game completion.

Started playing again after many years due to a frustration over some of the career races - specifically the stunt / freestyle events which I couldn't seem to get a handle of.

Speedworld achievement also took quite a while to get.  Took lots of notes and listed times for each track to beat helped narrow down which ones were left after career mode was completed.
