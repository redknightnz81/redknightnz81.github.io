After making a long post about all the gamerscore I was (hoping) going to get, I can't help but feel quite disappointed in myself after achieving a pitiful amount of gamerscore on the long weekend just been.

I did manage to get almost all of the achievements for SBK-X completed on my PAL console (have NTSC and PAL copies). The game does say that I haven't unlocked quite a few of the helmets. This includes the Milestone helmet, even though I have unlocked the achievement for wearing it on specific race / track.

Don't think I will be bothering to play it again for a while, as get pretty frustrated thinking about how long I spent going through the career from the beginning to get the It's a long way to the top achievement. Must have been at least 10 hours.

Purchased the NFS: The Run DLC, even though I had myself convinced I shouldn't. But adding some new events in has helped with the grind to get to level 30 for the last achievement. Then just the objectives in multiplayer which should be reasonably easy to boost.

Had a look on Amazon for some NTSC region locked games. Saw that Nascar Unleashed and Jimmie Johnson's Anything With An Engine were relatively cheap.

If only the shipping wasn't a killer I would have bought them. The games were $45USD total, but the shipping was another $35 for the cheapest option! The US$ to NZ$ may be heavily in my favour, but damn that is still expensive.

Still waiting on SBK 08 (NTSC) that was sent out on first days of January. Hopefully it should get here soon. Haven't had an issue with US postal service / eBay before.

Also need to think about getting a design done for this website too....
