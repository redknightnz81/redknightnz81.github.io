Very easy 200G (gamerscore) for this one.

Took longer to create a US account and download it, then to complete the game.

Think it took less than 20 minutes and all done.

Has been delisted from other marketplaces, so needed to create a US account to get it from there â€“ may come in handy to get the Days of Thunder arcade game as well lol if I set it up with some points to use.
