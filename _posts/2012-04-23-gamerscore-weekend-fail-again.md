Didn’t really get as much gamerscore as I had hoped this weekend.
Had got myself thinking that I should game non-stop all weekend and get to 80K.
This was obviously not going to happen.
Firstly, V8 Supercars were on TV. Yay for TV3s shitty delayed and advert-filled coverage and secondly I have been quite unmotivated towards gaming recently.
Thinking about throwing in the towel and moving onto something else non-gaming related.

I did however still manage to complete 2 games: Crash Time 1 (PAL) and Ski-Doo Challenge.
Crash Time 1 wasn’t very hard at all – even on highest difficulty. I had been spreading out the “Cases” during the week.
Think I will hold off on going through the NTSC version for doubling up achievements.

Tried to go back to SBK 08 (US) but just couldn’t seem to get anywhere with the challenges :(
Same with Indianapolis 500 Evolution.

Played some Nascar The Game 2011 which wasn’t too bad.
Got an achievement late Sunday night before heading off to watch the F1 race from Bahrain in bed at midnight (fell asleep and woke up on last lap hahaha).

Ordering MotoGP 10/11 for a boosting session in mid-May shortly. Should arrive in plenty of time (from UK).
Yay for cheap PAL imports from UK and bypassing the outrageous retail prices here in New Zealand.
