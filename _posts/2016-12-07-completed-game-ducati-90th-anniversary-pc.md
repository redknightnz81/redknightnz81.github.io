Very average racing game overall
Full of bugs - started crashing every 20 mins or so during single player career, even after turning graphics setting down to lowest.
Multiplayer achievements were also a pain to get as they only counted wins, and even then not every time.  Took a lot longer than needed to get them.
Another Milestone made mess of a game.
