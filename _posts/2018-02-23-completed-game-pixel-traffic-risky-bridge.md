Very easy game to get through, just involves tapping a single key to stop the nearest bridge platform from moving.  Clicking on the platform itself is not necessary.  Just anywhere on the game screen is OK.

All the achievements can be gotten in an hour or so, there isn't any grindy long achievements like in Circle Rush - another game by same company.

Completion time for all achievements is about an hour.
